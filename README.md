Branch: A branch in Git is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on different versions of your project at the same time. You can create a branch to experiment, make changes, and then merge it back into the main project (usually the main or master branch).
Clone: To clone a repository means to create a local copy of a remote repository on your machine. It allows you to work with the repository locally while maintaining a connection to the original (remote) version.
Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the code in a Git repository. It includes a unique ID, a message describing the changes, and a record of what was modified. Commits allow you to track the history of your project.
Fetch: Fetch refers to the process of downloading changes from a remote repository to your local machine, without merging those changes into your local branches. This allows you to see what others have changed before deciding to integrate those changes.
GIT: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files, typically in a software development project. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of all changes made.
Github: GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a web-based interface to manage, share, and collaborate on Git projects. It includes features like pull requests, issue tracking, and access control.
Merge: Merge is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. It is commonly used to integrate changes from a feature branch into the main branch (e.g., main or master). Merging can be done automatically by Git, but sometimes manual intervention is needed (if there are conflicts).
Merge Conflict: A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge two branches due to conflicting changes in the same part of a file. This happens when two changes are made to the same line or area of a file in different branches. You have to manually resolve the conflict before completing the merge.
Push: Push refers to sending your local changes (commits) to a remote repository. This makes your changes available to others working on the same project. Pushing is typically done after committing changes locally.
Pull: Pull refers to fetching changes from a remote repository and automatically merging them into your local branch. It is essentially a combination of git fetch and git merge in one step.
Remote: A remote is a version of a repository that is hosted on a server or a cloud service like GitHub. It is a shared repository where multiple developers can collaborate. The most common remote is origin, which refers to the default remote repository.
Repository: A repository is a storage space where your projectâ€™s files and history are stored. It contains all of the files, commits, branches, and history for a specific project. Repositories can be local (on your machine) or remote (on GitHub or another hosting platform).
